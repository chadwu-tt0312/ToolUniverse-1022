> What scientific tools are available?
✦ The ToolUniverse provides a wide range of scientific tools for research. Here are some of the main categories:

   * Drug Discovery and Pharmacology: Tools for drug discovery, including target validation, drug-target
     interaction, and adverse event reporting. Examples: OpenTargets, DrugBank, FAERS, ADMET-AI.

   * Genomics and Proteomics: Tools for genomics and proteomics research, such as protein structure prediction,
     genome-wide association studies, and protein database search. Examples: AlphaFold, GWAS, Human Protein
     Atlas (HPA), UniProt, Gene Ontology (GO), Protein Data Bank (PDB).

   * Bioinformatics Databases: Access to various bioinformatics databases. Examples: Reactome (biological
     pathways), Cellosaurus (cell lines), MeSH (Medical Subject Headings).

   * Scientific Literature Search: Tools to search for scientific articles and publications. Examples: PubMed,
     EuropePMC, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar.

   * Molecular and Structural Visualization: Tools for visualizing molecules and protein structures in 2D and
     3D.

   * Astronomy and Physics: Libraries for astronomy and physics research. Examples: Astropy, Sunpy, Galpy,
     PyEphem, QuTiP.

   * Geospatial Analysis: Tools for geospatial data analysis. Examples: xesmf, rasterio, geopandas, cartopy.

   * Neuroscience: Tools for neuroscience research and data analysis. Examples: MNE, Nilearn, Brian2, Elephant,
     Neo.

   * Clinical Trials: Tools for searching and analyzing clinical trial data.

  You can use the find_tools command to search for specific tools by keyword. For example: find_tools
  query="protein structure".
